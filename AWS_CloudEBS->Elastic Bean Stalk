Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment
and management of applications in various programming languages, frameworks, and environments. 
It abstracts away the complexities of infrastructure management and allows developers to focus on writing code
while AWS handles the deployment, scaling, and maintenance tasks.
