Instance Stores :
Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.
An instance store(opens in a new tab) provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance.
An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, 
and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) :
it is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances.
If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.

Amazon EBS snapshots :
An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. 
This means that the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data.
For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved. 
Incremental backups are different from full backups, in which all the data in a storage volume copies each time a backup occurs. 
The full backup includes data that has not changed since the most recent backup.

Amazon S3 :
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)(opens in a new tab) is a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
Object-level storage operates at a high level, treating data as discrete objects.Each object consists of data, metadata, and a unique identifier.

EFS :
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)(opens in a new tab) is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
As you add and remove files, Amazon EFS grows and shrinks automatically. It can scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting application
