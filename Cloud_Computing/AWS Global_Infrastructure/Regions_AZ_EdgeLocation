Regions: 
A Region is where all of the pieces and parts of your application live
Each Region is made up of multiple data centers.It has at least 2 AZ . 
The business decision maker, gets to choose which Region you want to run out of. 
And each Region is isolated from every other Region in the sense that absolutely no data goes in or out of your environment in that Region
without you explicitly granting permission for that data to be moved.

Factors to choose your region :
*Compliance : (Do you have a requirement your data must live in UK boundaries? Then you should choose the London Region, full stop.)
*Proximity : (How close you are to your customer base)
*feature availability :(Sometimes the closest Region may not have all the AWS features you want )
*Pricing : (Even when the hardware is equal one Region to the next, some locations are just more expensive to operate in)

Availibility zones :
AWS calls a single data center or a group of data centers, an Availability Zone
And as a best practice with AWS, we always recommend you run across at least two Availability Zones in a Region.
This means redundantly deploying your infrastructure in two different AZs.
Edge Location :
An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content
closer to your customers for faster delivery.
They are seperated from regions .
