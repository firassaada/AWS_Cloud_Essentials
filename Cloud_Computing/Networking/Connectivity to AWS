Virtual Private Cloud :
Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network
that you define. Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets.

Subnet :
A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.
Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website.
Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers’ personal
information and order histories. 

Intrnet Gateway :
To allow public traffic from internet you attach an internet gateway to the VPC .

packet filtering .
