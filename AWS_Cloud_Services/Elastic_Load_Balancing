Elastic Load Balancing is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. 


# Types of ELB :
 *Classic Load Balancer (CLB):
It supports routing traffic based on either application or network-level information. 

*Application Load Balancer (ALB):
The Application Load Balancer operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and is designed to route traffic based on content, such as HTTP/HTTPS.
ALB supports features like host-based and path-based routing, allowing you to route traffic to different targets based on the content of the request.
*Network Load Balancer(NLB):
The Network Load Balancer is designed to handle high volumes of incoming traffic, operating at the transport layer (Layer 4).
NLB is capable of handling Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic.
