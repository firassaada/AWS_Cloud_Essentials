Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) :
it is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances.
If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.
U can create it with hard drives that are not tied directly to the host yu're running EC2 on(but it has to be on the same AZ)
Can only be accessed by one instance
Size up to 16Tb
Stores data in a single AZ
