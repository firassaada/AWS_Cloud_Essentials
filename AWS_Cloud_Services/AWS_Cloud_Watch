# Amazon CloudWatch :
Amazon CloudWatch(opens in a new tab) is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics
CloudWatch uses metrics(opens in a new tab) to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics 
to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time. 

# CloudWatch alarms :
With CloudWatch, you can create alarms(opens in a new tab) that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold. 
For example, suppose that your company’s developers use Amazon EC2 instances for application development or testing purposes. If the developers occasionally forget 
to stop the instances, the instances will continue to run and incur charges. 
In this scenario, you could create a CloudWatch alarm that automatically stops an Amazon EC2 instance when the CPU utilization percentage has remained below a certain 
threshold for a specified period. When configuring the alarm, you can specify to receive a notification whenever this alarm is triggered.
