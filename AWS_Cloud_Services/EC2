Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 is a service that allows third parties to rent servers on which to run their own web applications. 
EC2 allows extensible deployment of applications by providing a web interface through which a client can create virtual machines,
instances of the server, on which the client can load any software of its choice .
With an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.
    You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
    You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
    You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
    You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.

Amazon EC2 types :
*General purpose:
General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources
*Compute optimized:
Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors
*Memory optimized :
Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. 
(lots of data to process)
*Accelerated computing :
Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.
*Storage optimized :
Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.
